## Python for Data Science

We will be using the FiveThirtyEight [article](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/puerto-rico-media) about Puerto Rico and media attention

This orientation session will be tailored to doing some data analysis in Python using the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) data science package. A really good blog post to step you through some more in-depth pandas learning is linked [here](https://medium.com/dunder-data/how-to-learn-pandas-108905ab4955). This tutorial is very distilled down.

Note, for analysis we will be using these date cutoffs:
* Hurricane Harvey makes landfall 8/25/17 
* Hurricane Irma makes landfall 9/10/17
* Hurricane Maria makes landfall 9/20/17

We will use these datasets and step through some basic data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization using Python
